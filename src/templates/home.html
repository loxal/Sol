        <strong>Loxal</strong> is a
        <strong>research, development, and business</strong> platform for various projects and concepts.
        Sol and its technology base offer
        many advantages to the conventional hosting models.

        <abbr title='Test Driven Development'>TDD</abbr> is the guiding concept for all upcoming releases of sol.
        Therefore underlying Unit Tests will ensure the proper functionality of every important function to provide a
        bug free application experience.
        <abbr title='Quality Assurance'>QA</abbr> methods are important for process critical applications.
        But manual QA processes are error-prone and not consistent.
        <em>Automatic QA</em> guarantees a coherent and consistent QA process and therefore <em>reliable application
        behavior and consistent quality</em>.
